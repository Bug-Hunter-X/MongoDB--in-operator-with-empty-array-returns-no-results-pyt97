# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The issue arises when using `$in` with an empty array to query a field that might be null or have a default value.  The query unexpectedly returns no results instead of returning documents where the field is null or has a default value.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a MongoDB collection and populate it with sample data (e.g., documents where the 'field' may be null, undefined or have a default value).
3. Run the Javascript code provided in 'bug.js'. This will execute a query using the `$in` operator with an empty array.
4. Observe that the query returns an empty array, even if there are documents where 'field' is null or has a default value.

## Solution
The solution involves handling the empty array case explicitly to return the expected results. This can be achieved by only using the `$in` operator if the array isn't empty, otherwise using an alternative query like `$exists` or a direct null check to find the desired documents.

See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
